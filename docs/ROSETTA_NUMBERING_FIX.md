# Rosetta Numbering Fix - The Real Issue!

## Root Cause Found!

The error message revealed the real problem:
```
ERROR: Assertion `pose.residue(resnum).name1() == wt` failed.
```

**Rosetta `cartesian_ddg` uses Rosetta's internal (pose) numbering, NOT PDB numbering!**

## The Problem

- **PDB file** starts numbering at residue 30
- **Rosetta** numbers residues sequentially from 1
- **Mutation file** was using PDB numbering (150, 160, 180, etc.)
- **Rosetta** expected internal numbering (121, 131, 151, etc.)

## The Mapping

| PDB Residue | Rosetta Residue | Mutation |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 150 | 121 | D → G |
| 160 | 131 | S → A |
| 180 | 151 | A → F |
| 185 | 156 | W → V |
| 206 | 177 | D → N |
| 224 | 195 | R → F |
| 237 | 208 | H → N |
| 238 | 209 | S → L |

## The Fix

Updated `configs/rosetta/mutlist.mut` to use Rosetta's internal numbering instead of PDB numbering.

## Why This Happened

The PDB file was generated by Rosetta relaxation, which preserved the original PDB numbering (starting at 30). When Rosetta reads the file, it renumbers internally starting from 1, but `cartesian_ddg` expects mutations to be specified using this internal numbering.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Mutation file now uses Rosetta numbering
2. Re-run DDG calculation - should work now!
3. Mutations should process correctly
